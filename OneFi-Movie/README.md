Alamofire - Used it because it simplifies a number of common networking tasks, it makes development faster and easier. Alamofire is also great for Asynchronous tasks. The nature of the task, though small and the timeframe to develop are the reasons why I used this library. The framework is well maintained, tested, and used so concerns of dependency didn’t arise  when I was taking this decision.
